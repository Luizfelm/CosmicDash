# **Cosmic Dash**

Cosmic Dash began as a simple Unity project I created to teach my students the basics of game development — from movement and collisions to scoring and game flow.

But as I worked on it, I found myself genuinely enjoying the process. What started as a teaching example quickly became a project I wanted to improve just for fun. Now, I’ve decided to keep developing it with the help of the open-source community.

## **The Game**

You control a spaceship that moves left and right, shooting incoming asteroids.

- **Controls**  
  Move: **A / D**  
  Shoot: **Space Bar**

- **+100 points** for each asteroid destroyed  
- If an asteroid **hits your ship**, it's **game over**  
- If an asteroid **passes by**, you lose **1 shield**  
- You start with **3 shields** — lose them all, and the game ends

## **Planned Features**

Now that the core is working, I plan to keep evolving the game for fun and learning. Here are some features I want to add:

- **Touch controls** for mobile support  
- **Rive-powered UI**  
- **Loading screen**
- **Visual effects**, **explosions**, and **screen feedback**  
- **Sound effects** and **background music**  
- **Animations and polish**  
- **Difficulty scaling** as the game progresses  
- **Power-ups**, **new enemy types**, and new mechanics  
- **Leaderboards**, **achievements**, and more challenges  
- Anything else cool that comes from the community!
